Vision
======

I use GitHub tickets extensively to manage development with a distributed multidiciplinary team.

My aspiration is a tool that:
 * automates some of the work I do in the ticket system
 * streamlines ticket creation tasks, and improves the quality of information captured on initial ticekt creation
 * allows me to have different processes for different projects, and supports easy continuous improvement of processes in a project

Bugflow is my name for that tool.
