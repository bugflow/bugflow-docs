Vision
======

I use GitHub tickets extensively to manage development with a distributed multidiciplinary team.

My aspiration is a tool that:

* automates some of my manual work
* streamlines ticket creation tasks
* improves the quality of information captured when tickets are created
* allows me to have different processes for different projects
* supports easy continuous improvement of processes in a project
* is fun to hack on

Bugflow is my name for that tool.
